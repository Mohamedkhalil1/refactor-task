# User Story: Loyalty System Database Design



## As a software developer, I need to design a loyalty system database to track customer rewards and transactions. The loyalty system should include the following features:



1. Customer Management:

- Store customer information such as name, contact details, and membership status.

- Assign a unique identifier (ID) to each customer for easy retrieval.



2. Rewards Program:

- Define a catalog of available rewards with details such as name, description, and point cost.

- Track the points earned by each customer for their transactions.

- Link customers to their earned rewards and redemption history.



3. Transaction Tracking:

- Capture transaction details including date, time, customer ID, and purchase amount.

- Calculate and update the earned loyalty points for each transaction.



4. Tiered Membership Levels:

- Implement a tiered membership system with different levels (e.g., Silver, Gold, Platinum).

- Define the benefits, rewards, and privileges associated with each membership tier.



5. Reporting and Analysis:

- Generate reports on customer activity, including points earned, redeemed rewards, and tier status.

- Analyze customer behavior and identify trends to improve the loyalty system.



This user story assesses the ability to design a loyalty system database, covering:

- Customer management and identification.

- Rewards program and tracking earned points.

- Recording and analyzing transaction data.

- Implementing tiered membership levels for different benefits.

- Generating reports and analyzing customer activity.



The database design should consider appropriate tables, columns, relationships, and data types to effectively store and retrieve the required information for the loyalty system.
